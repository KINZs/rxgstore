<p>These feathery creatures are fragile and easily spooked.</p>
<p>Using this item will throw a chicken towards where your crosshair is pointed. Similar to the mechanics of grenade throws, the player's velocity affects how the chicken will fly.</p>
<p>Throwing a chicken at one of your existing chickens or a teammate's chicken will cause one of them to absorb the other and grow in size. Doing the same to an enemy chicken will shrink it.</p>
<p>Standing too close to a surface or object you are looking at while throwing a chicken may result in the chicken getting stuck.</p>
<p>It is not possible to directly damage your own chickens, but grenades will work.</p>
